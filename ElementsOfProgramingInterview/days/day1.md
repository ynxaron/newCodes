This was the first day of doing Elements of Programing Interview, and I intend to
do however much or little I can till the day I finish the book, from start to finish,
not leaving a page (can't say about the problems) unread and unsolved.

Today I learned about bit manipulation, which was quiet trippy but I am understanding it a little
and now I will take a break because from 3 in the afternoon I need to study for my college. It
is 2 right now, and 1 hour break would be quiet appropriate.

Hopefully this would get more elaborate as more and more days pass by
